        <p>Football (sometimes called <del>SOCCER</del>). A game played on a rectangular field between 2 teams consisting of 11 players each on the field at all times.

    <!--"Subpositions" meaning the actual positions, like central midfielder-->
    Each general position has a set of "subpositions" (other than the goalkeeper). It is as follows:
    <!--A table showing the subpositions and abbreviations of each position-->
<fieldset>
    <table style="width:100%">

    <h3 style="background-color: burlywood;">Goalkeepers</h3>
    <figure>

    </figure>
    <h4 style="background-color: burlywood;">Role:</h4>
    <p>A goalkeeper (sometimes called the goalie, keeper, or goaltender) is the last line of defense in a game of football. Often goalies are the most athletic on the team, as they need to be quick athletic, and have storng hands. Goalies need to have sure hands as they will need to learn to catch all kinds of balls. Just one mistake could cost a goal, maybe the game.</p>
    <h4 style="background-color: burlywood;">Stopping balls:</h4>
    <p>Stopping a rolling ball sounds easy, but the ball could have a particular spin or strange bounce making it harder to stop. Stopping a ball in the air can also be tricky. They can curve, dive, and just move erratically because of their spin, lack of spin, or speed. Another option to stop a ball is to just block it. Either by hitting it away, punching, or even kicking. However, goalies must be careful not to deflect in the direction of an opposing team. Sometimes goalies dive on the ground to deflect rolling balls, and sometimes they need to jump to deflect high balls in the air.</p>
    <h4 style="background-color: burlywood;">Communication:</h4>
    <p>The goalkeeper needs to be able to communicate and cooperate with the defenders. Since the goalie has the best view of the field, he/she can call out any unmarked players or approaching players. The goalie can be seen as the director of the defense.</p>
    <br/>
    <h3 style="background-color: burlywood;">Defenders</h3>

    </figure>
    <h4 style="background-color: burlywood;">Role:</h4>
    <p>An outfield player who's primary rol is to stop attacks, and prevent the opposing team from scoring goals.</p>
    <h4 style="background-color: burlywood;">Passing:</h4>
    <p>Defenders should be good at passing, to be able to keep the ball away from the opponent with precise and well positioned passes.</p>
    <h4 style="background-color: burlywood;">Communication:</h4>
    <p>Defenders should be good at communicating as they will move around a lot when the opposing team attacks. They should be able to communicate with the goalie and with eachother.</p>
    <br/>
    <h3 style="background-color: burlywood;">Midfielders</h3>
    <figure>
        <img src="images/midfielder.jfif" width="420px" height="270px" alt="A midfielder in soccer running with the ball" title="Midfielder running with the ball.">
    </figure>
    <h4 style="background-color: burlywood;">Role:</h4>
    <p>Midfielders assist with both attacking and defending. They remain near the ceneter of the field and either assist with attacking or defending depending on what the situation calls for. There are certain midfielder roles that are primarily for defending and roles primarily for attacking. Such as: CDM, and CAM.</p>
    <h4 style="background-color: burlywood;">Communication:</h4>
    <p>They need excellent communication because they could sometimes be attacking and sometimes defending. They need to be able to communicate with both the defenders and forwards for both defending and attacking.</p>
    <br/>
    <h3 style="background-color: burlywood;">Forwards</h3>
    <figure>
        <img src="images/forwardattacker.jfif" width="420px" height="270px" alt="A male soccer player preparing to shoot the ball" title="Soccer player shooting a ball">
    </figure>
    <h4 style="background-color: burlywood;">Role:</h4>
    <p>A forward/attackers main role is to score goals. They are responsible for attacking and goal scoring, which is essential to win a game of football.</p>
    <h4 style="background-color: burlywood;">Communication</h4>
    <p>Forwards need to have good communication in order to set up attacks, as usually they will need to adapt on the field.</p>
